## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a parameterized Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog with a default operand width of 8 bits.
The ALU supports a wide range of arithmetic, logical, and special signed operations and is designed for flexibility, scalability, and synthesizability.

### Key highlights:

Parameterized operand width (default: 8 bits)

Logical and arithmetic modes controlled by a mode signal

Single-cycle and multi-cycle latency depending on operation

Verification using a structured self-checking testbench with coverage analysis

---

## 🎯 Objectives
 
- Implement an efficient **synthesizable Parameterized ALU** in Verilog.  
- Apply **linting** to improve quality and maintainability.  
- Verify functionality with **directed, random, and corner-case tests**.  
- Achieve **high code coverage** across all supported operations.  

---

## 🏗️ Design Architecture
- **Inputs**: `clk`, `reset`, `ce`, `opa`, `opb`, `inp_valid`, `mode`, `cmd`  
- **Outputs**: `res`, `cout`, `oflow`, `g/l/e`, `zero`, `err`  

### Supported Operations
**Unsigned Arithmetic**: ADD, SUB, ADD_CIN, SUB_CIN, INC/DEC, CMP, ADD_MUL, SH_MUL  
**Signed Arithmetic**: SP_1 (signed add + compare), SP_2 (signed sub + compare)  
**Logical**: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT_A, NOT_B, SHL_1,SHR_1, ROL, ROR  

---

## ⏱️ Timing Behaviour
- **1 cycle latency** → Most operations  
- **2 cycle latency** → Multi-cycle ops (e.g., multiplication)  
- Operates synchronously on **posedge clk** with clock enable (`ce`)  

---

## 🧪 Verification & Testbench
The verification environment is modular and **self-checking**, ensuring correctness and traceability.

- **Stimulus file**: `stimulus.txt` (57-bit wide test vectors)  
- **Driver**: Sends inputs and expected results to DUT and Scoreboard  
- **DUT**: ALU RTL implementation  
- **Monitor**: Observes DUT activity  
- **Scoreboard**: Compares actual vs expected, logs into `result.txt`  

✔ 100+ test cases executed (functional + edge + corner cases)  
✔ High **code coverage** achieved (line, branch, toggle)  

---

## ✅ Results
- Verified correct behaviour across all operations  
- Corner cases tested: clock disable, back-to-back MUL/ADD, CMD variations  
- **Synthesized** using Xilinx Vivado → Clean, hardware-compatible RTL  
- **Simulated** using Questa SIM → Observed waveforms + correctness logs  
- **Scoreboard results** stored in `result.txt`  

---

## 📊 Quality Assurance
- **Linting** → Fixed coding style & synthesis issues  
- **Coverage** → Ensured all CMD cases & logic paths are tested  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
- Successfully designed & verified a **parameterized ALU**  
- Achieved **robust verification** with scoreboard and coverage  
- Clean, scalable RTL → reusable in larger **processor/SoC projects**  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- ⏩ Add **pipelining** for higher performance  
- 🧾 Apply **formal verification**  
- ⚡ Optimize for **power and area**  
- ➕ Extend support for **new operations**
